  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project explores how AI is used in academic settings and how students can use it responsibly. We are currently in the early stages of developing our experiment and framework.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>We primarily aim at creating a simple, practical framework that will remind students to perceive AI as a beneficial tool, but not something they have to rely on. The framework will not be fixed or quantitative - it will be on guidelines, awareness and ethical thinking.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Research the impacts of AI on academic integrity.</li>
      <li>Create and develop a framework for guidance on responsible AI use.</li>
      <li>Complete an experiment with two student groups, one controlled.</li>
      <li>Analyze results using some visualization software.</li>
      <li>Add visuals or some graphics to the project website.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Current Stage</h2>
    <p>We are <strong>starting the experiment planning phase</strong>. Interviews and testing will begin soon, and the framework will continue to be updated based on what we learn.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Team</h2>
    <p><strong>Victor & Erin</strong> – Research ethics, responsible use.<br>
    <strong>Mustafa & Mohammad</strong> – Visuals, and website development.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Simple Framework (Draft)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use AI to support research and learning.</li>
      <li>Avoid copying pasting answers.</li>
      <li>Be aware of emotional overreliance on AI LLM's.</li>
      <li>Use AI in an efficient way to reduce unnecessary resource usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small-note">This framework is subject to change as the experiment stage of the project continues.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Experiment (In Progress)</h2>
    <p>We are going to compare two sets of students who will use AI as they wish (and the other set will use our framework). Activities will involve summarizing, writing and basic academic activities. We will see how they decide to use AI and how they are experiencing the process.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Contact / Updates</h2>
    <p>As the project continues, this website will be updated with results, visualizations.</p>
